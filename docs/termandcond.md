## Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure

Each party shall maintain, in the strictest confidence, all Confidential Information (as defined in the next sentence) of the other party. “Confidential Information” means all (i) nonpublic information (at the time of disclosure) disclosed by one party to the other party under this Agreement, provided such information is marked or indicated by the disclosing party to be confidential; (ii) and any information which ought reasonably be considered confidential with regard to the circumstances surrounding disclosure, whether or not such information is marked “Confidential”.

In the event a party is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or other governmental order, such party shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law or opinion of counsel, provide the other party with prompt notice prior to any disclosure so that the party or its client may seek other legal remedies to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information.

Each party receiving Confidential Information shall be responsible for any breach of this provision that is caused by any of its employees, affiliates, representatives or agents and such party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against any liabilities, claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses resulting, directly or indirectly, from any breach by a party, or any of its employees or independent contractors, of any provision of this Agreement. The obligations of this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of 3 years.

## Ownership and Licenses

Contractor agrees that the deliverables and materials developed pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, all presentations, writings, ideas, concepts, designs, text, plans, and other materials that Contractor conceives and develops pursuant to this Agreement, including all materials incorporated therein whether such materials were conceived or created by Contractor individually or jointly, on or off the premises of Client, or during or after working time) shall be treated as if the development of such deliverable constitutes a “work for hire” and shall be owned by Client upon payment of all fees due to Contractor pursuant to this Agreement.

In the event that any such material is considered not to be a “work made for hire,” Contractor hereby assigns all ownership (whether represented or not by a registered patent, copyright, trade secret) and other proprietary or rights, title and interest in such deliverables and materials to Client, and agrees to execute such documents as Client may reasonably request, in order to assist Client in obtaining and protecting such rights.

Contractor agrees that Contractor has no interest in any materials that Contractor submits to Client, including, without limitation, any security interest therein, and hereby releases to Client any interest therein (if any) which may be created by operation of law. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing and as necessary in the performance of this Agreement, Contractor shall have no rights to license, sell or use the deliverables or materials developed under this Agreement, or any portion thereof.

## Non-Solicit

Contractor agrees that during the period in which it is providing Services and for one year thereafter, Contractor will not encourage or solicit any employee, vendor, client or contractor of Client to leave Client for any reason.

## Relationship of Parties

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint or co-venture, agency, or employment relationship between Contractor and Client. Both Parties agree that Contractor is, and at all times during this Agreement shall remain, an independent contractor.

## Term & Termination

Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, upon 14 days written notice.
Either Party also may at any time terminate the Agreement immediately if: (i) the other party commits a breach of this Agreement and such party does not cure a breach within 5 days of written notice from the non-breaching party of such breach.

If this Agreement is terminated earlier by Client without cause, Client agrees to pay Contractor any and all sums which are due and payable for:

- (i) services provided as of the date of termination; and
- (ii) expenses already incurred, including those from documented non-cancelable commitments. Contractor agrees to use the best efforts to minimize such costs and expenses.

Termination for any reason shall not affect the rights granted to Client by Contractor hereunder. Upon termination, Client shall pay to Contractor all undisputed amounts due and payable. If upon termination Client has not paid undisputed fees owed for the material, deliverables or Services provided by Contractor as of the date of termination, Client agrees not to use any such material or the product of such Service, until Client has paid Contractor in full. Any provisions or clause in this Contract that, by its language or context, implies its survival shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Contractor shall retain a perfected security interest in the deliverable or material until Client has made payment in full for all undisputed amounts as of the termination date. Contractor hereby agrees to release and waive its security interest in the deliverable and material upon receipt of full payment for all undisputed amounts.

**{{ $frontmatter.company }}**’s acceptance of such service charges does not waive its rights to any remedies for **{{ $frontmatter.client }}**’s breach of this Agreement. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable.

## Deposit

A deposit of **{{$frontmatter.deposit}}** is due upon the acceptance of this Agreement before work will begin.

The **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** will give the **{{ $frontmatter.client }}** written notice of any such increase and, in the event that the **{{ $frontmatter.client }}** does not accept the corresponding increase in charges, **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** shall have the right without limiting its other rights or remedies to terminate the Contract by giving written notice to the **{{ $frontmatter.client }}**.

For all purposes of this Agreement, the Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in the **{{ $frontmatter.company }}**’s jurisdiction.

The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

## Force Majeure

No failure or omission by a party in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or create any liability if such failure or omission shall arise from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of such party which cannot be overcome through that party’s reasonable diligence, e.g., strikes, riots, war, acts of terrorism, acts of God, severe illness, invasion, fire, explosion, floods and acts of government or governmental agencies or instrumentalities.

## Notices

Any notices to either Party made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made and sent (i) via US mail or a nationally recognized carrier to the other Party’s address on file; (ii) or via e-mail to the other Party’s designated representative.

## Appropriate Conduct

**{{ $frontmatter.client }}** and **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** will seek to maintain a professional relationship that is free from harassment of any kind and from any other offensive or disrespectful conduct. If at any time during the term of this Agreement **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** believes that he/she has been subjected to harassing behavior on the part of **{{ $frontmatter.client }}** or **{{ $frontmatter.client }}**’s staff, **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** will notify **{{ $frontmatter.client }}** immediately and demand that appropriate actions will be taken to correct the matter. In the event that the reported behavior continues following **{{ $frontmatter.company }}**’s second notice, such behavior will constitute a breach of this Agreement and entitle **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the Agreement’s Term and Termination Clause, and be paid in full for the ordered project or for the planned monthly service hours, as applicable, without limiting any other right or remedy available to **{{ $frontmatter.company }}** by law.

## Miscellaneous

The section and subsection headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be used in interpreting this Agreement. Both parties have had the opportunity to review this Agreement and neither party will be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for the purposes of interpreting any ambiguity in this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement may be signed by manual or facsimile signatures and in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. In the event that any provision of this Agreement will be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be first revised to give the maximum permissible effect to its original intent or, if such revision is not permitted, that specific provision will be eliminated so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
